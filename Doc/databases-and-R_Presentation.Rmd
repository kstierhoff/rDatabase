## What is a database

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Why put data in a database?
- Getting away from working with static flat files with multiple copies/versions
- Centralize data storage to use by many at once
- Enforce data integrity
- Working efficiently with large amounts of data 

## How do we get data from databases?


## How can we get data from a database using R?


## Motivation for this presentation?

The materials in this presentation have been largely adapted from the Rstudio Webinar by Edgar Ruiz entitled: [Best practices for working with databases](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/best-practices-for-working-with-databases-webinar/).

A great resource for tools and best practices when working with databases in R can be found here: [db.rstudio.com](http://db.rstudio.com/). 

## Goals of this talk
- Take advantage of database engines to speed workflow by analyzing data in place (e.g., using SQL Engine)
- Taking advantage of `tidyverse` tools (e.g., piped code using ` %>% `) to facilitate data access rather than SQL
- Encouraging reproducible research by linking data to analysis
- **New:** Connections Pane in Rstudio IDE (>v1.1)  

## Connections pane in Rstudio
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
